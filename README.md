# Mandelbrot Set

In this assigiment we will write code that will generate a image of the [mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).

This image will be generate using one of this:

    1. A sequencial algorithm in cpp.
    2. The above algorithm modified to use openMP.
    3. A program written in CUDA.

As we move foward this readme will be updated.
